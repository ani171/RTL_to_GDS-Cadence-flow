# Logic synthesis
* The interconnection of logic gates is the process by which RTL is converted to an equivalent circuit.

## Constraints
* Constraints guide the design flow, ensuring the circuit meets functionality and performance goals. They are applied during various steps in VLSI chip implementation to ensure timing, design rules, etc., are met. The Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tool uses these constraints as input.
* Purpose of Constraints
    * Guide design flow from initial synthesis to final implementation.
    * Ensure the circuit meets functionality and performance goals.
* Types of Constraints
    * Timing Constraints: Ensure signals arrive on time.
    * I/O Constraints: Specify input/output characteristics.
    * Area Constraints: Define physical space limits.
    * Power Constraints: Set power consumption limits.
