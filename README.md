# RTL to GDS

* The RTL to GDS flow is a crucial process in the design and manufacturing of integrated circuits <br>
**RTL** - Register Transfer Level <br>
* This is a high-level representation of a digital circuit. Engineers write code in hardware description languages (HDLs) like VHDL or Verilog, describing how data flows between registers and how the logic operations are performed. <br>
**GDS** - Graphic Data System <br>
* This is the final output format used to fabricate the IC. It contains the detailed geometrical shapes that define the layout of the IC on a semiconductor wafer
